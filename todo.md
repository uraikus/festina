# Roadmap

What's next, roughly in priority order. Not a promise of timeline — see
[`tests/CONTRACT.md`](tests/CONTRACT.md) and
[api.md](api.md) for what's already implemented and working today.

## macOS support

Currently Linux-only, verified against a real (or virtual) X server and
ALSA device — neither exists on macOS. To get a checkout running there:

- **Graphics**: the runtime's graphics translation unit
  (`runtime/festina_runtime_graphics.c`) is built directly on Xlib —
  macOS has no native X11 server (XQuartz is a third-party install, not
  built in). Either require XQuartz as a documented dependency (least
  work, worst experience) or add a second graphics backend behind the
  same `festina_runtime.h` function surface (`festina_graphics_init`,
  `festina_draw_*`, event registration, ...) targeting Cocoa/AppKit
  directly — the C runtime's public API is already fully opaqued to
  `void*`/primitive types (see [security.md](security.md#binary-slimming)'s
  note on why that split was possible at all), so a second backend
  would slot in the same way the graphics/audio split already does:
  compiled in and linked only when needed, per platform this time
  instead of per feature.
- **Audio**: same shape of problem — `festina_runtime_audio.c` is ALSA-
  specific (Linux only). macOS's native equivalent is CoreAudio; needs
  its own backend behind `loadAudio`/`.play()`/`.stop()`/`.isPlaying()`.
- **Build**: `pkg-config`/Homebrew paths, and confirming
  `libLLVM`/clang's toolchain behaves the same way on macOS as it does
  via the Debian/Ubuntu path this repo's tests currently exercise (see
  [setup.md](setup.md) — the Homebrew install line there is written but
  not yet verified in CI).
- **Packaging**: `scripts/package_compiler.sh` (PyInstaller) should work
  largely as-is, but the packaged binary itself needs testing on macOS,
  not just Linux.

## Windows support

Bigger gap than macOS — several of the runtime's POSIX assumptions don't
hold at all:

- **`<regex.h>`** (`claude.md #67/#68`'s regex support) isn't part of
  MSVC's C runtime — needs either a POSIX-compatibility shim (MinGW
  ships one) or swapping to a different regex approach on that target.
- **Graphics/audio**: same backend problem as macOS, but targeting
  Win32/GDI (or Direct2D) and WASAPI/DirectSound instead.
- **`<sys/select.h>`/`nanosleep`/`clock_gettime`** (the timer event
  loop — `festina_run_event_loop`/`festina_run_timer_loop`, see
  [security.md](security.md#binary-slimming)) are POSIX-only; Windows
  has its own equivalents (`WaitForMultipleObjects`,
  `QueryPerformanceCounter`, ...) that would need their own codepath.
- **Static sqlite3 linking** (see [setup.md](setup.md#static-linking-sqlite3))
  and **pkg-config** itself both work differently (or need an
  alternative, e.g. vcpkg) on Windows — the whole dependency-detection
  path in `festina/cli.py` assumes a pkg-config-shaped world.
- **Toolchain**: whether `festina/llvm_backend.py`'s libLLVM approach
  works unmodified against an MSVC/MinGW-produced `libLLVM`, or needs
  its own fallback story the way the clang-IR-frontend fallback exists
  for "no libLLVM" today.

Given the size of this gap, Windows support is likely to land in stages
(e.g. WSL/MinGW-based support first, native MSVC later), similar to how
"real compilation, minimal setup" (`claude.md #59`) was staged rather
than attempted as one change — see [api.md](api.md#compilation-pipeline).

## HTTP

Festina currently has no networking support at all — no HTTP client, no
HTTP server, no sockets of any kind. This is the single biggest gap
between "a language with SQLite/graphics/audio built in" and "a language
you'd reach for to build an actual application," and it's also why
[benchmark.md](benchmark.md) can't yet compare anything more realistic
than CPU-bound micro-benchmarks against Rust/Go/Bun (all three of which
have HTTP in their standard library or a dominant idiomatic choice).

Rough shape, following the same pattern established by SQLite/graphics/
audio (a small set of global functions/builtins, backed by a new runtime
translation unit that only links in when used — see
[security.md](security.md#binary-slimming)):

- An HTTP **client** first (lower risk, smaller surface —
  request/response as structs or a handful of builtin functions), likely
  on top of a minimal bundled implementation rather than a new external
  dependency, in keeping with `claude.md #59`'s minimal-dependencies
  principle (the same reasoning that picked Xlib over a GUI toolkit and
  ALSA over SDL_mixer).
- An HTTP **server** after that — needs a story for how request handling
  interacts with the existing timer/graphics event loop
  (`festina_run_event_loop`/`festina_run_timer_loop`), since Festina is
  currently single-threaded and cooperative outside of audio's one
  background-thread carve-out.
- TLS is its own decision point (bundled library vs. OS-provided vs.
  plaintext-only for a first cut) — deliberately not decided here.

Not started — no design doc, no `claude.md` section number reserved for
it yet. First step is likely a `claude.md` addition (the spec has led
every feature built so far, including this one's own audit process) and
a benchmarks addition once real (server) benchmarks are possible.

## Smaller, not yet tracked elsewhere

Not roadmap items in the same sense as the three above — known gaps
called out in [`tests/CONTRACT.md`](tests/CONTRACT.md) and
[api.md](api.md) that stay deliberately unresolved per `claude.md #54`'s
ambiguity rule (unspecified stays unresolved rather than invented),
listed here only so they aren't lost:

- No `break`/`continue` (claude.md doesn't define either).
- No garbage collection / automatic memory management for arrays and
  structs (`claude.md #43` promises this; not implemented).
- `bool x = null` still doesn't compile (unlike `int`/`float`, which
  were fixed — see [security.md](security.md)).
- `regex()` recompiles its pattern on every call (no caching).
